# GMIT-PFORCS
GMIT programming labs and practise

This repository contains directories for each week of labs in Programming for CyberSecurity.

The labs are used for study purposes and will can be of benefit to look back on for reference.

The Practise directory is used for trying out projects. Some of these projects are from an Udemy basic python course that I am undertaking.
